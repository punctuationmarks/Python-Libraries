# Python-Libraries
Quick reminders and tutorials on useful Python libraries


Most, if not all, of these were made with Google Colab [Google Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com "Google Colab"), which if you're not aware, it's a super nice JupyterNotebook-ish service that will let you use a free GPU or TPU (and a fast CPU if you don't need anything fancy). Buuut with that being said, some of the syntax might look a little wanky, Google Colab has a specific synatx, some of it is discussed in my [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/punctuationmarks/Python-Libraries/blob/master/Google_Colab.ipynb).
